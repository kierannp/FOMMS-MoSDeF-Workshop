    "an important tool for accessing and storing workflow metadata such that the workflow\n",

    "part of the TRUE nature of computational research. The importance of managing a complex\n",
    "workflow, such as one shown in the figure below, is becoming increasingly vital for\n",

    "3. Run _HOOMD-blue_ simulations and process data in a standardized format for easy extension of the project aims.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. How to operate/set up a _[Signac](https://signac.io/)_ workflow.\n",
