        "In this tutorial, we'll show a workflow that involves multiple steps of initializing a system and running simulations. In this case, part of initializing a system invovles running a simulation where the final structure of the simulaton serves as the input for the next round of system building and simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specifically, the goal of this workflow is to model the fusion joining (i.e. welding) of two separate pieces of bulk polymer melt**. This requires that we have an equilibrated polymer melt system with at least 1 flat surface (i.e. where the periodic boundaries are eliminated). For the purposes of this tutorial, we will refer to this as a \"slab\". Once a slab structure has been created, we will create an interface system where two slabs are joined together, and run a fusion welding simulation. Finally, the welded system will be tested using a tensile test simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this tutorial will go through the following workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialize a new polymer system using poly(ethylene)\n",
        "2. Run a simulation which yields a poly(ethylene) slab\n",
        "3. Build a system that is an interface between 2 poly(ethylene) slabs.\n",
        "4. Run a fusion welding simulation\n",
        "5. Run a tensile test simulation\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step utilizes the same base classes dicussed in the introduction tutorial where we pull from `flowermd.library.polymers` and `flowermd.base.system` to build up poly(ethylen) chains and create an initial system. However, the rest of the workflow will use `flowermd.modules.welding` and `flowermd.library.simulations.tensile`.  These two modules inheret from the base `flowermd.base.Simulation` class and contain additional features geared towards this specific workflow."
